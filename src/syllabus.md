## :books: Fundamentals of Web Application Development

_any questions or issues may be sent to me directly_ [me@jordanforeman.com](mailto:me@jordanforeman.com)

### About the Course

This course is intended to provide a solid foundation for developing sites and applications for the web using modern web development technologies. Students will be exposed to a wide variety of tools, languages, and frameworks with the goal of establishing a high-level understanding of what is required to develop software for use on the web.

### Prerequisites

This course is aimed at those with zero experience in "writing code". The only requirements are a computer and and internet connection.

### Skill-Based Objectives

Upon completing this course, students will be have a familiarity with the following (in no particular order):

#### Basic HTTP Architecture

* Client-Server communications
* RESTful APIs

#### Software Development Lifecycle

* Common Agile practices
* Version Control Systems (git)
* Continuous Integration & Delivery (CI/CD)

#### Front End Web Development

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* React

#### Server-Side Web Development

* RESTful APIs with Node.js

#### Database Management Systems

* MySQL
* NoSQL

If that seems like a lot, don't worry! Much of the course content will build on top of previous elements, and should be digestible incrementally. If you are concerned about the order in which these topics will be discussed, please consult the course [table of contents](/contents).

### Project-Based Objectives

Many in the technology industry prefer a "show don't tell" approach when demonstrating aptitude. As such, this course aims to provide students with several opportunities to demonstrate the skills they acquire as part of the learning process. Upon completion, you should have several projects you can point to as demonstrations of your skillset, including (but not limited to):

* A static portfolio website at a domain of your choosing
* A GitHub profile with several code samples to draw upon
    * A small RESTful API (written in Node or Java)
    * Code snippets demonstrating a basic understanding of MySQL and NoSQL principles
